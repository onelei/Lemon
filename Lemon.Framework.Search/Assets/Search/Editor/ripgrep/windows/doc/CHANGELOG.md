14.0.0 (2023-11-26)
===================
ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new
features, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.

The headlining feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,
they are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.
To enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],
then try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience
with hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.

[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611

Another headlining development in this release is that it contains a rewrite
of its regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for
some searches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite
on my blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or
regressions that you notice][report-perf].

[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652

Finally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users
should not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed
somewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,
things like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all
filtering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control
systems such as `git`).

[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to
  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.
  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.

Build process changes:

* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep
with a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a
man page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.
* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been
dropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now
owns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.

Performance improvements:

* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):
  Make some cases with inner literals faster.
* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):

13.0.0 (2021-06-12)
===================
ripgrep 13 is a new major version release of ripgrep that primarily contains
bug fixes, some performance improvements and a few minor breaking changes.
There is also a fix for a security vulnerability on Windows
([CVE-2021-3013](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3013)).

Some highlights:

A new short flag, `-.`, has been added. It is an alias for the `--hidden` flag,
which instructs ripgrep to search hidden files and directories.

ripgrep is now using a new
[vectorized implementation of `memmem`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/memchr/pull/82),
which accelerates many common searches. If you notice any performance
regressions (or major improvements), I'd love to hear about them through an
issue report!

Also, for Windows users targeting MSVC, Cargo will now build fully static
executables of ripgrep. The release binaries for ripgrep 13 have been compiled
using this configuration.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

**Binary detection output has changed slightly.**

In this release, a small tweak has been made to the output format when a binary
file is detected. Previously, it looked like this:

```
Binary file FOO matches (found "\0" byte around offset XXX)
```

Now it looks like this:

```
FOO: binary file matches (found "\0" byte around offset XXX)
```

**vimgrep output in multi-line now only prints the first line for each match.**

See [issue 1866](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1866) for more
discussion on this. Previously, every line in a match was duplicated, even
when it spanned multiple lines. There are no changes to vimgrep output when
multi-line mode is disabled.

**In multi-line mode, --count is now equivalent to --count-matches.**

This appears to match how `pcre2grep` implements `--count`. Previously, ripgrep
would produce outright incorrect counts. Another alternative would be to simply
count the number of lines---even if it's more than the number of matches---but
that seems highly unintuitive.

**FULL LIST OF FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS:**

Security fixes:

* [CVE-2021-3013](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3013):
  Fixes a security hole on Windows where running ripgrep with either the
  `-z/--search-zip` or `--pre` flags can result in running arbitrary
  executables from the current directory.
* [VULN #1773](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1773):
  This is the public facing issue tracking CVE-2021-3013. ripgrep's README

12.1.1 (2020-05-29)
===================
ripgrep 12.1.1 is a patch release that fixes a couple small bugs. In
particular, the ripgrep 12.1.0 release did not tag new releases for all of its
in-tree dependencies. As a result, ripgrep built dependencies from crates.io
would produce a different build than compiling ripgrep from source on the
`12.1.0` tag. Namely, some crates like `grep-cli` had unreleased changes.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #1581](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1581):
  Corrects some egregious markup output in `--help`.
* [BUG #1591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1591):
  Mention the special `$0` capture group in docs for the `-r/--replace` flag.
* [BUG #1602](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1602):
  Fix failing test resulting from out-of-sync dependencies.


12.1.0 (2020-05-09)
===================
ripgrep 12.1.0 is a small minor version release that mostly includes bug fixes
and documentation improvements. This release also contains some important
notices for downstream packagers.

**Notices for downstream ripgrep package maintainers:**

* Fish shell completions will be removed in the ripgrep 13 release.
  See [#1577](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1577)
  for more details.
* ripgrep has switched from `a2x` to `asciidoctor` to generate the man page.
  If `asciidoctor` is not present, then ripgrep will currently fall back to
  `a2x`. Support for `a2x` will be dropped in the ripgrep 13 release.
  See [#1544](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1544)
  for more details.

Feature enhancements:

* [FEATURE #1547](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1547):
  Support decompressing `.Z` files via `uncompress`.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #1252](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1252):
  Add a section on the `--pre` flag to the GUIDE.
* [BUG #1339](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1339):
  Improve error message when a pattern with invalid UTF-8 is provided.
* [BUG #1524](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1524):
  Note how to escape a `$` when using `--replace`.

  Substantially reduce peak memory usage when searching wide directories.
* [BUG #1571](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1571):
  Add note about configuration files in `--type-{add,clear}` docs.
* [BUG #1573](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1573):
  Fix incorrect `--count-matches` output when using look-around.


12.0.1 (2020-03-29)
===================
ripgrep 12.0.1 is a small patch release that includes a minor bug fix relating
to superfluous error messages when searching git repositories with sub-modules.
This was a regression introduced in the 12.0.0 release.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #1520](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1520):
  Don't emit spurious error messages in git repositories with submodules.


12.0.0 (2020-03-15)
===================
ripgrep 12 is a new major version release of ripgrep that contains many bug
fixes, several important performance improvements and a few minor new features.

In a near future release, I am hoping to add an
[indexing feature](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1497)
to ripgrep, which will dramatically speed up searching by building an index.
Feedback would very much be appreciated, especially on the user experience
which will be difficult to get right.

This release has no known breaking changes.

Deprecations:

* The `--no-pcre2-unicode` flag is deprecated. Instead, use the `--no-unicode`
  flag, which applies to both the default regex engine and PCRE2. For now,
  `--no-pcre2-unicode` and `--pcre2-unicode` are aliases to `--no-unicode`
  and `--unicode`, respectively. The `--[no-]pcre2-unicode` flags may be
  removed in a future release.
* The `--auto-hybrid-regex` flag is deprecated. Instead, use the new `--engine`
  flag with the `auto` value.

Performance improvements:

* [PERF #1087](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1087):
  ripgrep is smarter when detected literals are whitespace.
* [PERF #1381](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1381):
  Directory traversal is sped up with speculative ignore-file existence checks.
* [PERF cd8ec38a](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/cd8ec38a):
  Improve inner literal detection to cover more cases more effectively.
  e.g., ` +Sherlock Holmes +` now has ` Sherlock Holmes ` extracted instead
  of ` `.
* [PERF 6a0e0147](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/6a0e0147):
  Improve literal detection when the `-w/--word-regexp` flag is used.
* [PERF ad97e9c9](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/ad97e9c9):
  Improve overall performance of the `-w/--word-regexp` flag.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for erb, diff, Gradle, HAML, Org,
  Postscript, Skim, Slim, Slime, RPM Spec files, Typoscript, xml.
* [FEATURE #1370](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1370):
  Add `--include-zero` flag that shows files searched without matches.
* [FEATURE #1390](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1390):
  Add `--no-context-separator` flag that always hides context separators.
* [FEATURE #1414](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1414):
  Add `--no-require-git` flag to allow ripgrep to respect gitignores anywhere.
* [FEATURE #1420](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1420):
  Add `--no-ignore-exclude` to disregard rules in `.git/info/exclude` files.
* [FEATURE #1466](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1466):
  Add `--no-ignore-files` flag to disable all `--ignore-file` flags.
* [FEATURE #1488](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1488):
  Add '--engine' flag for easier switching between regex engines.
* [FEATURE 75cbe88f](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/75cbe88f):

===================
ripgrep 11.0.1 is a new patch release that fixes a search regression introduced
in the previous 11.0.0 release. In particular, ripgrep can enter an infinite
loop for some search patterns when searching invalid UTF-8.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #1247](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1247):
  Fix search bug that can cause ripgrep to enter an infinite loop.


11.0.0 (2019-04-15)
===================
ripgrep 11 is a new major version release of ripgrep that contains many bug
fixes, some performance improvements and a few feature enhancements. Notably,
ripgrep's user experience for binary file filtering has been improved. See the
[guide's new section on binary data](GUIDE.md#binary-data) for more details.

This release also marks a change in ripgrep's versioning. Where as the previous
version was `0.10.0`, this version is `11.0.0`. Moving forward, ripgrep's
major version will be increased a few times per year. ripgrep will continue to
be conservative with respect to backwards compatibility, but may occasionally
introduce breaking changes, which will always be documented in this CHANGELOG.
See [issue 1172](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1172) for a bit
more detail on why this versioning change was made.

This release increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.28.0 to
1.34.0.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* ripgrep has tweaked its exit status codes to be more like GNU grep's. Namely,
  if a non-fatal error occurs during a search, then ripgrep will now always
  emit a `2` exit status code, regardless of whether a match is found or not.
  Previously, ripgrep would only emit a `2` exit status code for a catastrophic
  error (e.g., regex syntax error). One exception to this is if ripgrep is run
  with `-q/--quiet`. In that case, if an error occurs and a match is found,
  then ripgrep will exit with a `0` exit status code.
* Supplying the `-u/--unrestricted` flag three times is now equivalent to
  supplying `--no-ignore --hidden --binary`. Previously, `-uuu` was equivalent
  to `--no-ignore --hidden --text`. The difference is that `--binary` disables
  binary file filtering without potentially dumping binary data into your
  terminal. That is, `rg -uuu foo` should now be equivalent to `grep -r foo`.
* The `avx-accel` feature of ripgrep has been removed since it is no longer
  necessary. All uses of AVX in ripgrep are now enabled automatically via
  runtime CPU feature detection. The `simd-accel` feature does remain available
  (only for enabling SIMD for transcoding), however, it does increase
  compilation times substantially at the moment.

Performance improvements:

* [PERF #497](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/497),
  [PERF #838](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/838):
  Make `rg -F -f dictionary-of-literals` much faster.

Feature enhancements:

  BuildStream, bzip2, C, C++, Cython, gzip, Java, Make, Postscript, QML, Tex,
  XML, xz, zig and zstd.

0.10.0 (2018-09-07)
===================
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that contains some major new
features, a huge number of bug fixes, and is the first release based on
libripgrep. The entirety of ripgrep's core search and printing code has been
rewritten and generalized so that anyone can make use of it.

Major new features include PCRE2 support, multi-line search and a JSON output
format.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* The minimum version required to compile Rust has now changed to track the
  latest stable version of Rust. Patch releases will continue to compile with
  the same version of Rust as the previous patch release, but new minor
  versions will use the current stable version of the Rust compile as its
  minimum supported version.
* The match semantics of `-w/--word-regexp` have changed slightly. They used
  to be `\b(?:<your pattern>)\b`, but now it's
  `(?:^|\W)(?:<your pattern>)(?:$|\W)`. This matches the behavior of GNU grep
  and is believed to be closer to the intended semantics of the flag. See
  [#389](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/389) for more details.

Feature enhancements:

* [FEATURE #162](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/162):

  Add `--json` flag that prints results in a JSON Lines format.
* [FEATURE #321](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/321):
  Add `--one-file-system` flag to skip directories on different file systems.
* [FEATURE #404](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/404):
  Add `--sort` and `--sortr` flag for more sorting. Deprecate `--sort-files`.
* [FEATURE #416](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/416):
  Add `--crlf` flag to permit `$` to work with carriage returns on Windows.
* [FEATURE #917](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/917):
  The `--trim` flag strips prefix whitespace from all lines printed.
* [FEATURE #993](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/993):
  Add `--null-data` flag, which makes ripgrep use NUL as a line terminator.
* [FEATURE #997](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/997):
  The `--passthru` flag now works with the `--replace` flag.
* [FEATURE #1038-1](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1038):
  Add `--line-buffered` and `--block-buffered` for forcing a buffer strategy.
* [FEATURE #1038-2](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1038):
  Add `--pre-glob` for filtering files through the `--pre` flag.

* [BUG #200](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/200):
  ripgrep will now stop correctly when its output pipe is closed.
* [BUG #389](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/389):
  The `-w/--word-regexp` flag now works more intuitively.
* [BUG #643](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/643):
  Detection of readable stdin has improved on Windows.
* [BUG #441](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/441),
  [BUG #690](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/690),
  [BUG #980](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/980):

* [BUG #1028](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1028):
  Don't complete bare pattern after `-f` in zsh.


0.9.0 (2018-08-03)
==================
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that contains some minor new
features and a panoply of bug fixes.

Releases provided on Github for `x86_64` will now work on all target CPUs, and
will also automatically take advantage of features found on modern CPUs (such
as AVX2) for additional optimizations.

This release increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.20.0 to
1.23.0.

It is anticipated that the next release of ripgrep (0.10.0) will provide
multi-line search support and a JSON output format.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* When `--count` and `--only-matching` are provided simultaneously, the
  behavior of ripgrep is as if the `--count-matches` flag was given. That is,
  the total number of matches is reported, where there may be multiple matches
  per line. Previously, the behavior of ripgrep was to report the total number
  of matching lines. (Note that this behavior diverges from the behavior of
  GNU grep.)
* Octal syntax is no longer supported. ripgrep previously accepted expressions
  like `\1` as syntax for matching `U+0001`, but ripgrep will now report an
  error instead.
* The `--line-number-width` flag has been removed. Its functionality was not
  carefully considered with all ripgrep output formats.
  See [#795](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/795) for more
  details.

0.8.0 (2018-02-11)
==================
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that satisfies several popular
feature requests (config files, search compressed files, true colors), fixes
many bugs and improves the quality of life for ripgrep maintainers. This
release also includes greatly improved documentation in the form of a
[User Guide](GUIDE.md) and a [FAQ](FAQ.md).

This release increases the **minimum supported Rust version** from 1.17 to
1.20.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

Note that these are all very minor and unlikely to impact most users.

* In order to support configuration files, flag overrides needed to be
  rethought. In some cases, this changed ripgrep's behavior. For example,
  in ripgrep 0.7.1, `rg foo -s -i` will perform a case sensitive search
  since the `-s/--case-sensitive` flag was defined to always take precedence
  over the `-i/--ignore-case` flag, regardless of position. In ripgrep 0.8.0
  however, the override rule for all flags has changed to "the most recent
  flag wins among competing flags." That is, `rg foo -s -i` now performs a
  case insensitive search.
* The `-M/--max-columns` flag was tweaked so that specifying a value of `0`
  now makes ripgrep behave as if the flag was absent. This makes it possible
  to set a default value in a configuration file and then override it. The
  previous ripgrep behavior was to suppress all matching non-empty lines.
* In all globs, `[^...]` is now equivalent to `[!...]` (indicating class
  negation). Previously, `^` had no special significance in a character class.
* For **downstream packagers**, the directory hierarchy in ripgrep's archive
  releases has changed. The root directory now only contains the executable,
  README and license. There is now a new directory called `doc` which contains
  the man page (previously in the root), a user guide (new), a FAQ (new) and
  the CHANGELOG (previously not included in release). The `complete`
  directory remains the same.

Friends of ripgrep:

I'd like to extend my gratitude to
[@balajisivaraman](https://github.com/balajisivaraman)
for their recent hard work in a number of areas, and in particular, for
implementing the "search compressed files" feature. Their work in sketching out
a specification for that and other work has been exemplary.

Thanks
[@balajisivaraman](https://github.com/balajisivaraman)!

==================
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes one minor breaking
change, bug fixes and several new features including support for text encodings
other than UTF-8.

A notable accomplishment with respect to Rust is that ripgrep proper now only
contains a single `unsafe` use (for accessing the contents of a memory map).

The **breaking change** is:

* [FEATURE #380](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380):
  Line numbers are now hidden by default when ripgrep is printing to a tty
  **and** the only thing searched is stdin.

  SASS, SVG, Twig
* [FEATURE #1](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1):

  UTF-16 via BOM sniffing. Explicit text encoding support with the
  `-E/--encoding` flag was also added for latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP
  and Shift_JIS, among others. The full list can be found here:
  https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get
* [FEATURE #129](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/129):
  Add a new `-M/--max-columns` flag that omits lines longer than the given
  number of bytes. (Disabled by default!)
* [FEATURE #369](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/369):
  A new flag, `--max-filesize`, was added for limiting searches to files with
  a maximum file size.

Bug fixes:

* [BUG #52](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/52),
  [BUG #311](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/311):
  Tweak how binary files are detected and handled. (We are slightly less
  conservative and will no longer use memory without bound.)
* [BUG #326](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326):
  When --files flag is given, we should never attempt to parse positional
  arguments as regexes.
* [BUG #327](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/327):
  Permit the --heading flag to override the --no-heading flag.
* [BUG #340](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/340):
  Clarify that the `-u/--unrestricted` flags are aliases.
* [BUG #343](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/343):
  Global git ignore config should use `$HOME/.config/git/ignore` and not
  `$HOME/git/ignore`.
* [BUG #345](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/345):
  Clarify docs for `-g/--glob` flag.
* [BUG #381](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/381):
  Add license files to each sub-crate.
* [BUG #383](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/383):
  Use latest version of clap (for argv parsing).
* [BUG #392](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/391):
  Fix translation of set globs (e.g., `{foo,bar,quux}`) to regexes.
* [BUG #401](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/401):
  Add PowerShell completion file to Windows release.
* [BUG #405](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/405):
  Fix bug when excluding absolute paths with the `-g/--glob` flag.


0.4.0
=====
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes a couple very
minor breaking changes, a few new features and lots of bug fixes.

This version of ripgrep upgrades its `regex` dependency from `0.1` to `0.2`,
which includes a few minor syntax changes:

* POSIX character classes now require double bracketing. Previously, the regex
  `[:upper:]` would parse as the `upper` POSIX character class. Now it parses
  as the character class containing the characters `:upper:`. The fix to this
  change is to use `[[:upper:]]` instead. Note that variants like
  `[[:upper:][:blank:]]` continue to work.
* The character `[` must always be escaped inside a character class.
* The characters `&`, `-` and `~` must be escaped if any one of them are
  repeated consecutively. For example, `[&]`, `[\&]`, `[\&\&]`, `[&-&]` are all
  equivalent while `[&&]` is illegal. (The motivation for this and the prior
  change is to provide a backwards compatible path for adding character class
  set notation.)

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Crystal, Kotlin, Perl, PowerShell,
  Ruby, Swig
* [FEATURE #83](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/83):
  Type definitions can now include other type definitions.
* [FEATURE #243](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243):
  **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `--column` flag now implies `--line-number`.
* [FEATURE #263](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/263):
  Add a new `--sort-files` flag.
* [FEATURE #275](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/275):
  Add a new `--path-separator` flag. Useful in cygwin.

  Fix bug where patterns starting with a `-` couldn't be used with the
  `-e/--regexp` flag. (This resolves a regression that was introduced in
  ripgrep 0.3.0.)


0.3.1
=====
Bug fixes:

* [BUG #242](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/242):
  ripgrep didn't respect `--colors foo:none` correctly. Now it does.


0.3.0
=====
This is a new minor version release of ripgrep that includes two breaking
changes with lots of bug fixes and some new features and performance
improvements. Notably, if you had a problem with colors or piping on Windows
before, then that should now be fixed in this release.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

* ripgrep now requires Rust 1.11 to compile. Previously, it could build on
  Rust 1.9. The cause of this was the move from
  [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)
  for argument parsing.
* The `-e/--regexp` flag can no longer accept a pattern starting with a `-`.
  There are two work-arounds: `rg -- -foo` and `rg [-]foo` or `rg -e [-]foo`
  will all search for the same `-foo` pattern. The cause of this was the move
  from [Docopt to Clap](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/233)
  for argument parsing.
  [This may get fixed in the
  future.](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/742).

Performance improvements:

* [PERF #33](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/33):
  ripgrep now performs similar to GNU grep on small corpora.
* [PERF #136](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/136):
  ripgrep no longer slows down because of argument parsing when given a large
  argument list.

Feature enhancements:

* Added or improved file type filtering for Elixir.
* [FEATURE #7](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/7):
  Add a `-f/--file` flag that causes ripgrep to read patterns from a file.
* [FEATURE #51](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/51):
  Add a `--colors` flag that enables one to customize the colors used in
  ripgrep's output.
* [FEATURE #138](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/138):
  Add a `--files-without-match` flag that shows only file paths that contain
  zero matches.
